| **confusable_homoglyphs** | Character confusion detection | Simple API, basic detection | No attack reversal, limited to Unicode confusables, minimal maintenance |
| **life4/homoglyphs** | ASCII conversion | Simple conversion to ASCII | Limited homoglyph set, no context awareness, basic functionality |
| **codebox/homoglyph** | Search capabilities | Good for basic searches | JavaScript/Java only, no reversal capabilities, limited features |

### Key Advantages of SilverSpeak

1. **Advanced Context Matching**: SilverSpeak analyzes the surrounding text to select homoglyphs that match the local context in terms of Unicode properties (script, block, category, bidirectional, east_asian_width), ensuring visually coherent replacements. This feature is entirely absent in all other libraries.

2. **OCR-Based Confusables**: Beyond standard Unicode confusables, SilverSpeak includes characters that appear similar in OCR systems, making it substantially more comprehensive than libraries relying solely on Unicode definitions. Our OCR-based approach captures visual similarities that aren't defined in the Unicode standard.

3. **Multiple Normalization Strategies**: Offers various approaches to reverting homoglyph attacks:
   - Dominant script and block detection
   - Local context-based normalization
   - Tokenization-aware normalization
   - Language model-based normalization
   - Spell checking normalization
   - LLM prompt-based normalization
   
   Most other libraries either provide no normalization features or offer only basic detection/conversion without sophisticated reversal capabilities.

4. **Targeted Attack Capabilities**: Unlike competing libraries that focus solely on detection or simple random replacements, SilverSpeak provides sophisticated targeted attack strategies that can evade specific AI text detectors while maintaining human readability.

5. **Language Model Integration**: Built-in support for utilizing language models to improve normalization quality, a feature unavailable in any other homoglyph library.

6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensively tested against various attack scenarios, including tests against modern AI-generated text detectors, ensuring reliability in real-world applications.

7. **Active Research**: Developed as part of published academic research ["SilverSpeak: Evading AI-Generated Text Detectors using Homoglyphs"](https://aclanthology.org/2025.genaidetect-1.1/), with ongoing improvements based on new findings. None of the other libraries are backed by peer-reviewed research.

### Use Cases Where SilverSpeak Excels

While other libraries focus primarily on detection or simple character substitution, SilverSpeak shines in the following scenarios:

1. **AI Text Detection Evasion**: SilverSpeak was specifically designed to enable text to evade AI-generated text detectors while maintaining human readability, a capability not found in any other homoglyph library.

2. **Security Research**: For researchers examining how homoglyph attacks can affect modern NLP systems and security tools, SilverSpeak provides the most comprehensive toolkit available.

3. **Text Normalization**: When you need to normalize text containing homoglyphs back to standard characters, SilverSpeak offers multiple strategies with varying levels of sophistication to handle even the most complex cases.

4. **Language Processing Pipeline Protection**: SilverSpeak can be integrated into text processing pipelines to sanitize input text before it reaches sensitive language processing components.

5. **Content Moderation**: Unlike simple libraries that only detect basic homoglyphs, SilverSpeak's context-aware approach helps identify and normalize sophisticated homoglyph-based attempts to bypass content filters.

6. **Academic Research**: The research-backed approach and multiple normalization strategies make SilverSpeak ideal for academic studies in linguistic security and text processing.

7. **Cross-Language Text Processing**: With its advanced Unicode property analysis, SilverSpeak handles mixed-script text more effectively than alternatives.

Most other libraries were designed for simple use cases like domain spoofing detection or basic homoglyph identification, making them insufficient for advanced applications like those listed above.

# Reproducing the experimental results from the research paper
This library was developed as part of the paper ["SilverSpeak: Evading AI-Generated Text Detectors using Homoglyphs"](https://aclanthology.org/2025.genaidetect-1.1/). A part of the code in this repository is used to reproduce the results of the paper (check out the `v1.0.0` tag).

# Side note: where does the name "SilverSpeak" come from?

The name SilverSpeak comes from the expression _"Hablar en plata"_ in Spanish. While a literal translation would be _"Speak in silver"_, it means _"Speak clearly"_. Therefore, some people would understand the underlying meaning, while those unfamiliar with the expression would likely misunderstand it.

Homoglyph-based attacks are an effective evasion technique since they change the meaning that detectors perceive, while maintaining the same appearance to a human observer. We think the idea can be a metaphor of the system getting _"lost in translation"_, especially considering that homoglyphs are frequently identical characters in different languages.

Hereby the rationale behind our choice of the name _SilverSpeak_ to refer to the family of homoglyph-based attacks that we use in our paper. The attacks play with the understood meaning of the text, depending on who is the observer, taking advantage of codification differences across alphabets.
