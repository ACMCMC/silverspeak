Language Model Strategy
=======================

The Language Model Strategy is an advanced normalization approach that utilizes a pre-trained language model to predict the most contextually appropriate replacement for each character in the text. This strategy is particularly effective for handling complex normalization scenarios where linguistic context plays a crucial role.

Overview
--------

This strategy leverages the predictive capabilities of language models to address the challenge of text normalization in mixed-script or ambiguous contexts. By analyzing the surrounding context of each character, the language model can generate replacements that align with the intended meaning of the text. This approach is particularly useful for applications such as machine translation, text-to-speech systems, and natural language understanding.

Implementation Details
-----------------------

1. **Language Model Initialization**:
   The following code snippet demonstrates how to initialize a pre-trained language model and its tokenizer. These components are used to process the input text and generate predictions for masked tokens.

   .. code-block:: python

      from transformers import BertTokenizer, AutoModelForMaskedLM

      tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-multilingual-cased")
      model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("bert-base-multilingual-cased")

   In this step, the `transformers` library is used to load a multilingual BERT model and its corresponding tokenizer. The model is pre-trained on a diverse corpus of text, enabling it to handle a wide range of languages and scripts.

2. **Tokenization and Masking**:
   This snippet tokenizes the input text and replaces specific characters with a mask token to allow the model to predict their replacements.

   .. code-block:: python

      tokens = tokenizer("Example text with homoglyphs.", return_tensors="pt")["input_ids"].squeeze()
      tokens[5] = tokenizer.mask_token_id  # Mask a specific token

   Here, the input text is converted into a sequence of token IDs using the tokenizer. The `mask_token_id` is used to replace a specific token, indicating to the model that this token needs to be predicted based on its context.

3. **Prediction**:
   The following code snippet demonstrates how the language model generates predictions for the masked tokens. The top predictions are extracted and evaluated to determine the most contextually appropriate replacement.

   .. code-block:: python

      outputs = model(input_ids=tokens.unsqueeze(0))
      top_predictions = outputs.logits[0, 5, :].topk(10).indices
      predicted_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(top_predictions)

   The model processes the tokenized input and generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each token. The `topk` method is used to extract the top predictions for the masked token, which are then converted back into human-readable text using the tokenizer.

4. **Replacement**:
   This snippet applies the selected replacement to the text, completing the normalization process.

   .. code-block:: python

      normalized_text = "".join(predicted_tokens)

   The predicted tokens are concatenated to form the normalized text. This step ensures that the final output is coherent and contextually appropriate.

Example Usage
-------------

The following example demonstrates how to normalize a text using the Language Model Strategy. It initializes the language model and tokenizer, applies the strategy, and prints the normalized text.

.. code-block:: python

   text = "Example text with homoglyphs."
   normalization_map = {"a": ["α", "а"], "e": ["е", "ε"]}
   normalized_text = apply_language_model_strategy(
       text, normalization_map, model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer
   )
   print(normalized_text)

   In this example, the `apply_language_model_strategy` function is used to normalize the input text. The function leverages the language model to predict the most contextually appropriate replacements for homoglyphs, ensuring that the output text is both accurate and meaningful.

Key Considerations
-------------------
- The choice of language model significantly impacts the effectiveness of this strategy. A model trained on diverse multilingual data is recommended.
- This strategy is computationally intensive and may require GPU acceleration for efficient processing.
- It is particularly suitable for advanced text normalization tasks requiring deep contextual understanding.
