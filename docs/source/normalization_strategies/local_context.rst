Local Context Strategy
======================

The Local Context Strategy is a sophisticated normalization approach that leverages a sliding window mechanism to evaluate the local context of each character in the text. This strategy ensures that the selected replacement for a character aligns with the properties of its surrounding characters, thereby maintaining contextual consistency.

Overview
--------

This strategy is designed to address the challenge of mixed-script text, where characters from different scripts may appear together. By analyzing the local context of each character, the strategy ensures that replacements are contextually appropriate and consistent with the surrounding text. This approach is particularly useful for applications such as text normalization, data preprocessing, and security.

Implementation Details
-----------------------

1. **Sliding Window Context**:
   The following code snippet demonstrates how to use a sliding window to capture the local context around each character. The window dynamically adjusts at the boundaries of the text to ensure a consistent size.

   .. code-block:: python

      start = max(0, i - N // 2)
      end = min(len(text), i + N // 2 + 1)
      context_window = text[start:end]

   Here, the `start` and `end` indices define the boundaries of the sliding window. The window size is determined by the parameter `N`, which specifies the number of characters to include in the context. This step ensures that the context window is always centered around the target character, even at the edges of the text.

2. **Property Extraction**:
   This snippet extracts various properties (e.g., script, block, category) of the characters in the context window. These properties are used to evaluate possible replacements for the target character.

   .. code-block:: python

      PROPERTY_FNS = {
          "script": unicodedataplus.script,
          "block": unicodedataplus.block,
          "category": unicodedataplus.category,
          "bidirectional": unicodedata.bidirectional,
          ...
      }
      properties = {
          prop: [PROPERTY_FNS[prop](c) for c in context_window]
          for prop in PROPERTY_FNS
      }

   The `PROPERTY_FNS` dictionary maps property names to their corresponding functions. These functions are applied to each character in the context window to extract the relevant properties. The resulting `properties` dictionary contains a list of values for each property, which are used to evaluate the target character.

3. **Scoring and Selection**:
   The following code snippet demonstrates how to score each possible replacement based on how well its properties match those of the characters in the context window. The replacement with the highest score is selected.

   .. code-block:: python

      scores = []
      for possible_char in possible_chars:
          score = sum(
              PROPERTY_FNS[prop](possible_char) == value
              for prop, values in properties.items()
              for value in values
          )
          scores.append((possible_char, score))
      best_char, best_score = max(scores, key=lambda x: x[1])

   Here, the `scores` list stores the score for each possible replacement. The score is calculated by comparing the properties of the replacement character with those of the characters in the context window. The replacement with the highest score is selected as the best match.

4. **Tie Handling**:
   This snippet handles cases where multiple replacements have the same score. A warning is logged, and the first replacement is chosen.

   .. code-block:: python

      if len([s for s in scores if s[1] == best_score]) > 1:
          logging.warning(
              f"Tie detected for character '{char}' in context '{context_window}'."
          )

   In the event of a tie, the `logging.warning` function is used to log a message indicating that multiple replacements have the same score. The first replacement in the list is selected as the best match.

Example Usage
-------------

The following example demonstrates how to normalize a text using the Local Context Strategy. It applies the strategy to replace homoglyphs while maintaining contextual consistency.

.. code-block:: python

   text = "Example text with homoglyphs."
   normalization_map = {"a": ["α", "а"], "e": ["е", "ε"]}
   normalized_text = apply_local_context_strategy(text, normalization_map, N=10)
   print(normalized_text)

   In this example, the `apply_local_context_strategy` function is used to normalize the input text. The function leverages the sliding window mechanism to evaluate the local context of each character and select the most contextually appropriate replacement.

Key Considerations
-------------------
- The sliding window size `N` significantly impacts the performance and accuracy of this strategy. A larger window provides more context but increases computational complexity.
- This strategy is particularly effective for mixed-script texts or texts with frequent homoglyphs.
- The choice of properties and their corresponding functions in `PROPERTY_FNS` can be customized to suit specific applications.
